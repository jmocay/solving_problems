"""
    Given an even number (greater than 2),
    return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.

    A solution will always exist. See Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.

    Example:

    Input: 4
    Output: 2 + 2 = 4
        If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

    If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then

    [a, b] < [c, d]
    If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.
